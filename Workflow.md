  Example backend function:
  ```python
  import fitz
  from ollama import Client

  def summarize_pdf(file_path):
      doc = fitz.open(file_path)
      text = ""
      for page in doc:
          text += page.get_text()

      client = Client()
      summary = client.chat("llama3", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize: {text}"}])
      return summary['message']['content']
  ```

### ‚è≥ 3‚Äì5 Hour: Form Filling Assistant

- Frontend:

## ‚úÖ **Day 2: Q&A over Files + Resume Builder**

### ‚è≥ 0‚Äì2 Hour: Q&A Over PDFs, DOCs, PPTs

- Frontend:
  - Upload file + input box for questions.

- Backend:
  - Use python-docx, python-pptx, and pymupdf to extract text depending on file type.
  - When user asks a question, send prompt to Ollama:

    ```
    Based on the following document, answer: <Question>  
    Document: <Extracted Text>
    ```

- Return answer to frontend.

---

### ‚è≥ 2‚Äì5 Hour: Resume/CV Builder

- Frontend:
  - Simple multi-step form to collect:
    - Personal Info

    ```

- Ollama generates text.
- Optional: Generate PDF (using xhtml2pdf or ReportLab).

  Example libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install xhtml2pdf
  ```

## ‚úÖ **Day 3: To-Do List + Polishing + Final Testing**

### ‚è≥ 0‚Äì2 Hour: To-Do List & Reminder Assistant

- Models:
  - Create a `Task` model: `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `completed`.

- Views:
  - CRUD operations: Add task, mark as complete, delete task.

- AI:
  - Accept natural language tasks like:  
    `"Remind me to submit project tomorrow at 5 PM."`
  - Ollama parses into structured fields.

    ```
    Extract task title, date, and time from: <input>
    ```

- Bonus: Set up Django-Q for actual reminders (optional).

### ‚è≥ 2‚Äì5 Hour: Final Touches

- UI polishing using Bootstrap

  - PDF upload
  - Q&A
  - Resume Builder
  - Form Autofill
  - To-Do Task creation

- Deploy locally or on Render/Heroku (if extra time).
- Record small demos for LinkedIn posts/hackathon.

# üß† Priorities to Stick to Plan
- **Focus on 1 feature at a time** ‚Äî finish before jumping.
- **Always test small code pieces immediately.**
- **Hardcode prompts to Ollama first; optimize later.**
- **Frontend can be minimal. Backend must work smoothly.**
