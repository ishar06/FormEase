# 🗓 3-Day Plan (4–5 Hours/Day)

---

## ✅ **Day 1: Setup + PDF Summary + Form Filling Assistant**

### ⏳ 0–1 Hour: Project Setup
- Set up virtual environment
- Install Django, Ollama, fitz (PyMuPDF), python-docx, python-pptx

  ```bash
  pip install django ollama pymupdf python-docx python-pptx
  ```

- Start Django project:

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject formease
  cd formease
  python manage.py startapp core
  ```

- Basic settings: Add 'core' to `INSTALLED_APPS`, set up static files, configure media files (for file uploads).

---
  
### ⏳ 1–3 Hour: PDF Summary Feature

- Frontend:
  - Create a simple page where users upload PDFs.

- Backend:
  - Read the uploaded PDF using PyMuPDF.
  - Extract all text.
  - Send extracted text to Ollama to **summarize** using a prompt like:  
    `"Summarize the following text in bullet points: <text>"`

  Example backend function:
  ```python
  import fitz
  from ollama import Client

  def summarize_pdf(file_path):
      doc = fitz.open(file_path)
      text = ""
      for page in doc:
          text += page.get_text()

      client = Client()
      summary = client.chat("llama3", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize: {text}"}])
      return summary['message']['content']
  ```

---
  
### ⏳ 3–5 Hour: Form Filling Assistant

- Frontend:
  - Create a page with a basic form: Name, Email, Address, etc.

- Backend:
  - Allow users to upload a text file or give text input.
  - Use Ollama to parse data.
    - Example prompt: `"Extract name, email, address from the following: <text>"`
  - Autofill Django form fields based on extracted info.

---
  
## ✅ **Day 2: Q&A over Files + Resume Builder**

### ⏳ 0–2 Hour: Q&A Over PDFs, DOCs, PPTs

- Frontend:
  - Upload file + input box for questions.

- Backend:
  - Use python-docx, python-pptx, and pymupdf to extract text depending on file type.
  - When user asks a question, send prompt to Ollama:

    ```
    Based on the following document, answer: <Question>  
    Document: <Extracted Text>
    ```

- Return answer to frontend.

---

### ⏳ 2–5 Hour: Resume/CV Builder

- Frontend:
  - Simple multi-step form to collect:
    - Personal Info
    - Education
    - Experience
    - Skills

- Backend:
  - When user submits, **send structured input to Ollama**:
  
    ```
    Create a professional resume using the following details: <User Info>
    ```

- Ollama generates text.
- Optional: Generate PDF (using xhtml2pdf or ReportLab).

  Example libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install xhtml2pdf
  ```

- Allow users to download the generated resume.

---

## ✅ **Day 3: To-Do List + Polishing + Final Testing**

### ⏳ 0–2 Hour: To-Do List & Reminder Assistant

- Models:
  - Create a `Task` model: `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `completed`.

- Views:
  - CRUD operations: Add task, mark as complete, delete task.

- AI:
  - Accept natural language tasks like:  
    `"Remind me to submit project tomorrow at 5 PM."`
  - Ollama parses into structured fields.

    ```
    Extract task title, date, and time from: <input>
    ```

- Bonus: Set up Django-Q for actual reminders (optional).

---

### ⏳ 2–5 Hour: Final Touches

- UI polishing using Bootstrap
- Test all flows:
  - PDF upload
  - Q&A
  - Resume Builder
  - Form Autofill
  - To-Do Task creation

- Deploy locally or on Render/Heroku (if extra time).
- Record small demos for LinkedIn posts/hackathon.

---

# 🧠 Priorities to Stick to Plan
- **Focus on 1 feature at a time** — finish before jumping.
- **Always test small code pieces immediately.**
- **Hardcode prompts to Ollama first; optimize later.**
- **Frontend can be minimal. Backend must work smoothly.**
